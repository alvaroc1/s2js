S2JS Compiler Plugin
====================

Scala-to-Javascript compiler plugin that produces annotated javascript suitable for the closure compiler.

It is a work in progress, probably not usable yet.

The easiest way to play with it (at least for me) is using eclipse. Edit the "outputDir" value in S2JSComponent and run S2JSPluginRunner. 

You should be able to do step-through debugging.
